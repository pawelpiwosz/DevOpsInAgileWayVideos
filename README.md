# DevOps In Agile Way YouTube channel

**Hello!**

This repository contains commands or code used in the videos I share on [DevOps In Agile Way YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@devopsinagileway) channel.

Not all episodes have some code here.

You will not find deep explanations and stuff like this here. I explain things in the videos. Here you can find a code which I use and which you can simply copy if you like to play with the solutions I show.
